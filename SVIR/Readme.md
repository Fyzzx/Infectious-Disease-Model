This simple MATLAB live code shows how to go from the differeential equations governing the SIR model of infectious disease spread to a forward euler time stepped code. 

The options are, 
1.)S to I, 
2.)S to V, 
3.)V to S, 
4.)I to R, 
5.)R to S

each with their own associated (potentially time dependent) rate constants.

The mlx code is in order to explicitly show the differential equations within the lines of code.
